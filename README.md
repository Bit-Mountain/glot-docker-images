# glot-images


## Overview
glot-images are the docker images used by [glot.io](https://glot.io) to run code.
The images are built using nix which are pinned to a specific nixpkgs commit to create reproducible images.
Prebuilt images can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/glot).
See the [overview](https://github.com/prasmussen/glot) on how everything is connected.
